    "Now that we know what neurons are, we are ready for the final step: the neural net. A neural net is just a chain of neurons. We start by asking one question: what if we want multiple outputs?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multiple Output Models\n",
    "\n",
    "The last step is to ask about multiple output models. What if we wanted to distinguish between apples, bananas, *and* grapes? We could use vectors of `0` or `1` values to symbolize each output.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"data/fruit-salad.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 300px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we extend our previous model to give multiple outputs by repeating it with different weights. For the first element of the array we'd use:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sigma(x;w^{(1)},b) := \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-w^{(1)} \\cdot x + b^{(1)})}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "then for the second we'd use\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sigma(x;w^{(2)},b) := \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-w^{(2)} \\cdot x + b^{(2)})}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and if you wanted $n$ outputs, you'd have for each one:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sigma(x;w^{(i)},b) := \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-w^{(i)} \\cdot x + b^{(i)})}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that these equations are all the same except for the parameters. We can write this model succinctly too. Let's write $b$ in an array:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$b=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}\n",
    "b_{1}\\\\\n",
    "b_{2}\\\\\n",
    "\\vdots\\\\\n",
    "b_{n}\n",

    "$Wx$ is the operation called \"matrix multiplication\"\n",
    "\n",
    "[Show small matrix multiplication]\n",
    "\n",
    "It takes each column of weights and does the dot product against x (remember, that's how $\\sigma^{(i)}$ was defined) and spits out a vector from doing that with each column. The result is a vector, which makes this version of the function give a vector of outputs which we can use to encode larger set of choices. Matrix multiplication is also interesting since **GPUs are basically just matrix multiplication machines**, which means that by writing the equation this way it can be calculated really fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "This \"multiple input and multiple output\" version of the sigmoid function is known as a *layer of neurons*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously we worked with a single neuron, which we visualized as\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"data/single-neuron.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 300px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "where we have two pieces of data (green) coming into a single neuron (pink) that returned a single output. We could use this single output to do binary classification - to identify an image of a fruit as `1`, meaning banana or as `0`, meaning not a banana (or an apple).\n",
    "\n",
    "To do non-binary classification, we can use a layer of neurons, which we can visualize as\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "We now have stacked a bunch of neurons on top of each other to hopefully work together and train to output results of more complicated features. \n",
    "\n",
    "We still have two input pieces of data, but now we can imagine having a neuron that produces an output for each binary classification: \n",
    "* neuron 1: \"is it an apple?\"\n",
